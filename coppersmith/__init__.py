"""Educational Coppersmith toolkit (teaching-only).

Modules:
- poly: integer polynomial utilities (dict-based)
- lll: Fraction-based LLL reduction for integer matrices
- univariate: Howgraveâ€“Graham-style univariate small-root search
- bivar / bivariate: bivariate poly ops and small-root search with elimination
- elimination: Bareiss determinant, Sylvester matrix, interpolation resultant

Notes:
- This package is designed for clarity and reproducibility, not speed or hardening.
- All APIs intentionally use standard library types and explicit integer arithmetic.
